An old friend recently called my attention to a thoughtful essay by
Stanford statistics professor David Donaho, titled =E2=80=9C50 Years of Dat=
a
Science.=E2=80=9D
<http://courses.csail.mit.edu/18.337/2015/docs/50YearsDataScience.pdf>
Given the keen interest these days in data science, the essay is quite
timely. The work clearly shows that Donaho is not only a grandmaster
theoretician, but also a statistical philosopher. The paper should be
required reading in all Stat and CS Departments. But as a CS person with
deep roots in statistics, I believe there are a few points Donaho should
have developed more, which I will discuss here, as well as other points on
which his essay really shines.

Though no one seems to claim to know what data science is =E2=80=94 not eve=
n on an
=E2=80=9CI know it when I see it=E2=80=9D basis =E2=80=94 everyone seems to=
 agree that it is
roughly a combination of statistics and computer science. Fine, but what
does that mean? Let=E2=80=99s take the computer science aspect first.

By CS here, I mean facility with computers, and by that in turn I mean more
than programming. By happenstance, I was in a conversation today with some
CS colleagues as to whether material on computer networks should be
required for CS majors. One of my colleagues said there were equally
deserving topics, such as Hadoop. My reply was that Hadoop is SLOW (so much
so that many are predicting its imminent demise), and maximizing its
performance involves, *inter alia*, an understanding of=E2=80=A6computer ne=
tworks.
Donaho doesn=E2=80=99t cover this point about computation (nor, it seems, d=
o most
data science curricula), limiting himself to programming languages and
libraries.

But he does a fine job on the latter. I was pleased that his essay contains
quite a bit of material on R, such as the work of Yihui Xie and Hadley
Wickham. That a top theoretician devotes so much space in a major position
paper to R is a fine tribute to the status R has attained in this
profession.

(In that context, I feel compelled to note that in attending a talk at Rice
in 2012 I was delighted to see Manny Parzen, 86 years old and one of the
pioneers of modern statistical theory, interrupt his theoretical talk with
a brief exposition on the NINE different definitions of *quantile*
available in calls to R=E2=80=99s *quantile()* function. Bravo!)

Donahue notes, however, that the Berkeley data science curriculum uses
Python instead of R. He surmises that this is due to Python handling Big
Data better than R, but I suspect it has more to do with the CS people at
UCB being the main ones designing the curriculum, acting on a general
preference in CS for the =E2=80=9Cmore elegant=E2=80=9D language Python.

But is Python the better tool than R for Big Data? Many would say so, I
think, but a good case can be made for R. For instance, to my knowledge
there is nothing in Python like CRAN=E2=80=99s *bigmemory
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigmemory/index.html>* package,
giving a direct R interface to shared memory at the C++ level. (I also have
a parallel computation package, *Rdsm
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rdsm/index.html>*, that runs on
top of *bigmemory*.)

Regretably, the Donaho essay contains only the briefest passing reference
to parallel computation. But again, he is not alone. Shouldn=E2=80=99t a de=
gree in
data science, ostensibly aimed in part at Big Data, include at least some
knowledge of parallel computation? I haven=E2=80=99t seen any that do. Note=
,
though, that coverage of such material would again require some knowledge
of computer system infrastructure, and thus being at odds with the =E2=80=
=9Ca
little of this, a little of that, but nothing in depth=E2=80=9D philosophy =
taken so
far in data science curricula.

One topic I was surprised to see the essay omit was the fact that so much
data today is not in the nice =E2=80=9Crectangular=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 obser=
vations in rows,
variables in equal numbers of columns =E2=80=94 form that most methodology =
assumes.
Ironically, Donaho highlights Hadley Wickham=E2=80=99s *plyr* package, as
rectangular as can be. Arguably, data science students ought to be exposed
more to sophisticated use of R=E2=80=99s *tapply()*, for instance.

Now turning to the stat aspect of Data Science, a key theme in the essay
is, to borrow from Marie Davidian, aren=E2=80=99t WE (statistics people) Da=
ta
Science? Donaho does an excellent job here of saying the answer is Yes (or
if not completely Yes, close enough so that the answer could be Yes with a
little work). I particularly liked this gem:

It is striking how, when I review a presentation on today=E2=80=99s data sc=
ience,
in which statistics is superficially given pretty short shrift, I can=E2=80=
=99t
avoid noticing that the underlying tools, examples, and ideas which are
being taught as data science were all literally invented by someone trained
in Ph.D. statistics, and in many cases the actual software being used was
developed by someone with an MA or Ph.D. in statistics. The accumulated
efforts of statisticians over centuries are just too overwhelming to be
papered over completely, and can=E2=80=99t be hidden in the teaching, resea=
rch, and
exercise of Data Science.

Yes! Not only does it succinctly show that there is indeed value to theory,
but also it illustrates that point that many statisticians are not computer
wimps after all. Who needs data science?

I believe that Donaho, citing Leo Breiman, is too quick to concede the
prediction field to Machine Learning. As we all know, prediction has been
part of Statistics since its inception, literally for centuries. Granted,
modern math stat has an exquisitely developed theory of estimation, but I
have seen too many Machine Learning people make the absurd statement, =E2=
=80=9CML
is different from statistics, because we do prediction.=E2=80=9D

Indeed, one of Donaho=E2=80=99s most salient points is that having MORE met=
hods
available for prediction is not the same as doing BETTER prediction.
Indeed, he shows the results of some experiments he conducted with Jiashun
Jin on some standard real data sets, in which a very simple predictor is
compared to various =E2=80=9Cfancy=E2=80=9D ones:

Boosting, Random Forests and so on are dramatically more complex and have
correspondingly higher charisma in the Machine Learning community. But
against a series of pre-existing benchmarks developed in the Machine
Learning community, the charismatic methods do not outperform the homeliest
of procedures=E2=80=A6

This would certainly be a shock to most students in ML courses =E2=80=94 an=
d to
some of their instructors.

Maybe the =E2=80=9CR people=E2=80=9D (i.e. Stat Departments) have as much t=
o contribute to
data science as the =E2=80=9CPython people=E2=80=9D (CS) after all.
