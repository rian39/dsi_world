- odi talk -- david tarrant -  working with european data science academy; doing survey on being a data scientist. interviewing 500 people -- how do people communicate what they have found using verbal or visual. And open source tools and concepts
    - in order for innovation to be fast, it needs to be open.
    - we a team of 45 in London; convene people to innovate - Nigel Shadbolt; became a startup incubator as a startup. mastodonC was a startup focusing on carbon offsets. 
    - could do something with mastodonC -- what they did with nhs pharmaceutical dataset and statins; also opencorporates
    - when we engage, we start by talking about data science -- everyone has a different view; so we start with the training; then build the demonstrator; communicate
    - gives list of startups that odi have worked with, especially around the open data challenge in different areas; $EU 560k;$ PWC did the analysis - 10 x return on the money
    - odi metrics via an api
    - open data is like the beginning of the web -- this pattern is occurring again -- a web of data from devices (like documents); see McKinsey report on this; lets pick this figure apart someone said -- see ODI lecture -- figure wasn't big enough. this time it is happening much faster. Data becomes an infrastructure. See live data from the national grid -- its all on line. data helps us navigate to a decision;  
    - shows video about open data that spans nepal, burkin fasso, singapore, etc -- looks like a wifi -- video was made before nepal earthquake -- made using found video. 
    - using found video is a good method
    - syngenta and agritech data in europe -- who is the community for this?
    - list of odi certificate https://certificates.theodi.org/en/datasets -- a massive dataset 108M list of certified datasets

 - found type I and type ii data scientists described -- see Sheffield MSc. Also would be good to connect to different modes of science literature; Novotny, etc. http://www.oralytics.com/2013/03/type-i-and-type-ii-data-scientists.html

# TODO
- get Abbot's _Chaos of the Disciplines_ and see if relevant

- read Leydesdorff and makes notes on main argument "Decomposing social and semantic networks in emerging "big data" research" 
- DONE get text of Donaho article
- go through Donaho looking for reports and references to use
- TODO: add Donaho again to zotero
- TODO: go through the docs on dsis and look at again
